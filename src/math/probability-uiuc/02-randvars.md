# 2 - Random Variables

Summary of notes from lectures by Sheldon Jacobson
for the course IE 410 at UIUC in Fall 2021.

* Definitions: random variable, CDF.
* Distributions: Bernouilli, Binomial, Geometric, Negative binomial, Poisson.
* Approximating Binomial using Poisson, Poisson as limiting case of binomial.
* Distributions: Exponential, Gamma, Normal.
* Theorem: X ~ N(μ,σ) implies aX+b ~ N(aμ+b,aσ).
* Buffon Needle problem.
* Definition: expectation and variance.
* News vendor problem.
* Definition: Joint CDF and PMF.
* If X and Y are independent, then E(XY) = E(X)E(Y).
* Definition: covariance.
* Sum of Poisson randvars.
* Sum of exponential randvars.
* Theorem: Joint distribution of Y_1 and Y_2, where Y_1 = f_1(X_1, X_2) and Y_2 = f_2(X_1, X_2).
* Coupon collector problem.
* Definition: Moment-generating function (MGF).
* Theorem: MGF uniquely defines probability distribution.
* Theorem: MGF of sum of indep randvars is product of MGFs of those randvars.
* Markov's inequality.
* Chebychev's inequality.
* One-sided chebychev's inequality.
* Jensen's inequality.
* Weak and strong law of large numbers.
* Central limit theorem.
