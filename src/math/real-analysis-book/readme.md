# Introduction to Real Analysis

This directory contains the notes I made while reading
'Introduction to Real Analysis' by Robert G. Bartle and Donald R. Sherbert
([google books link](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Introduction_to_Real_Analysis/Sj7vAAAAMAAJ)).
The notes are mostly a summary of the book, but also contain some other related stuff.
