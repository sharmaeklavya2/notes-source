# 2 - High-Dimensional Space

1.  Introduction:
    * Summary of how high-dimensional space is different from low-dimensional space.
2.  Law of Large numbers:
    * Markov's inequality and proof.
    * Chebyshev's inequality and proof.
    * Upper-bound on volume of unit ball using law of large numbers.
    * Expected square distance between high-dim gaussians.
    * Master tail bounds theorem (proof in appendix).
    * Chernoff bound.
3.  The Geometry of High Dimensions:
    * Most of the volume of the unit ball lies in an annulus of width O(1/d) near the boundary.
4.  Properties of the Unit Ball:
    * Proof of V(d) = A(d)/d.
    * Computing exact value of A(d).
    * Proof that volume is concentrated near the equator.
    * Proof that two random vectors from the unit ball are nearly orthogonal.

    * Random projection theorem and its proof.
    * Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and its proof.
    * Using JL lemma for nearest neighbor search.
8.  Separating Gaussians:
    * Distance (or norm) between vectors from the same spherical gaussian.
    * Distance (or norm) between vectors from separated spherical gaussians.
9.  Fitting a Spherical Gaussian to Data:
    * Estimating mean.
    * Estimating variance.
