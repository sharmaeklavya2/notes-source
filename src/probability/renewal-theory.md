# Renewal Theory

Summary of Chapter 7 from
Introduction to Probability Models (11th ed)
by Sheldon M. Ross.

## 1 - Introduction

* Definition of inter-arrival/holding times, jump times, renewal process.
* Proof that N(t) is finite for all t.
* Proof that N(∞) = lim_{t → ∞} N(t) = ∞.

## 2 - Distribution of N(t)

* P(N(t) = n) in terms of cumulative distribution functions of jump times.
* P(N(t) = n) as an integral.
* m(t) = E(N(t)) in terms of cumulative distribution functions of jump times.
* Claim (without proof) that m(t) uniquely determines F.
* Claim (without proof) that m(t) is finite.
* Renewal equation

## 3 - Limit Theorems and their Applications

* N(t)/t converges to 1/μ when t → ∞.
* Example 7.7: analyzing dice games using renewal theory
* Elementary renewal theorem (without proof).
* Stopping time for a sequence of random variables.
* Wald's equation for stopping time.
* Proof of the elementary renewal theorem.
* Central limit theorem for renewal processes.

## 4 - Renewal Reward Processes

* Notation for rewards.
* R(t)/t converges to E(R)/E(X) when t → ∞.
* Elementary reward renewal theorem (without proof).
* Example 7.18: average age of renewal process.
* Example 7.20: average no. of people waiting at bus stop.
