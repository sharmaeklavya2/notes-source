# Notes from Kannada lectures

I'm watching a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOb5Wwt1GhOmfwBXC5IGuDvtNc-Ub8N1c)
to learn Kannada from Hindi. I'll write down notes from each video because
reading these notes is easier than rewatching the videos.

Although I'm only interested in learning spoken Kannada, and not written Kannada,
I'll write Hindi in the Devanagari script and Kannada in the Kannada script
in my notes (unlike the video series).
This is because in Hindi and Kannada, spelling is a very reliable guide to pronunciation,
and I can transliterate Kannada to Devanagari using [trin](https://sharmaeklavya2.github.io/trin/)
(look out for the
ट्र
icon in the notes).
I may break this rule if I can't find the Kannada spelling or
if I'm using foreign words in Kannada sentences.

Common abbreviations I'll use in my notes:

* `en`: english
* `kan`: kannada
* `hin`: hindi
* `dev`: devanagari
