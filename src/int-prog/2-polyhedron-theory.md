# 2 - Polyhedron Theory

* Defn: Linear combination, Conical combination, Affine combination, Convex combination.
* Defn: Linear independence, Affine independence.
* Lemma: {x^1, ..., x^n} are affinely independent iff {x^2 - x^1, x^3 - x^1, ..., x^n - x^1} are linindep.
* Lemma: {x^1, ..., x^n} are affinely independent iff {(x^1, a), (x^2, a), ..., (x^n, a)} are linindep,
    for any non-0 constant a.
* Lemma: size of max-size set of affinely independent solutions of Ax = b is n+1-rank(A).
* Defn: polyhedron and polytope.
* Defn: dimension of a polyhedron, full-dim polyhedron.
* Defn: implicit defining equalities of polyhedron.
* Lemma: If constraint a^Tx â‰¤ b is not an implicit equality, then a is not in span(A^=).
* Defn: inner point and interior point.
* Lemma: every non-empty polyhedron has an inner point.
* Lemma: dim(P) = n - rank(A^=).
* Lemma: valid inequality.
* Defn: face and proper face.
