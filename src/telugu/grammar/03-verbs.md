# Verbs

In this article, we will look at the different forms that verbs can have in Telugu.

I have created a [Google sheet][google-sheet] that contains many examples for
a large number of verb forms.
Some entries in the sheet don't follow the transformation rules described here.
Those entries are highlighted in red or yellow,
depending on how different they are from the transformation rule.

## Preface

### Sources

My primary source of Telugu grammar is the book
[An Intensive Course in Telugu](https://archive.org/details/dli.language.2300)
by Parimi Ramanarsimham.
The book has multiple chapters, each of which usually starts with
a dialogue in Telugu between people,
followed by exercises, vocabulary, and grammar notes related to the dialogue.
Since the grammar notes are fragmented across chapters,
it can be hard to refer to a particular topic.
This article, on the other hand, is a structured reference of verb forms.

In many cells of the [Google sheet][google-sheet], I have mentioned the
book chapter that I sourced the entry from
(where _ICT_ stands for _Intensive Course in Telugu_).

My second source of Telugu grammar is my wife, who is a native Telugu speaker from Telangana.
She said that Telangana uses a slightly different dialect of spoken Telugu
compared to the above book. In this article, I have tried documenting these differences
with regards to verb forms.

### What to Memorize

If you're learning Telugu, I recommend memorizing the following forms:

1.  The [imperative](#imperative) form (the primary/defining form).
2.  The [infinitive](#infinitive) form.
3.  The [present adverbial participle](#present-adverbial-participle).
4.  The [past adverbial participle](#past-adverbial-participle).

This is because these four forms can be used to derive almost all of the other forms.
Additionally, it's useful to also memorize the
[past adjectival participle](#past-adjectival-participle).

### Sandhi

We will learn how to transform a verb from one form to other forms.
To do these transformations, we will often need to join two words together.
This process of joining words is called సంధి (संधि / sandhi).
There are many different sandhi rules in Telugu, but for this article,
the rules given by the following table will suffice.
The rules depend on the kind of vowel the first word ends with
and the kind of character the second word starts with.
(Note that అ = अ is considered a vowel, so, e.g.,
మన ends with a vowel, but రాకేష్ and పుస్తకం don't.)

<table>
<tr>
    <th>1st ends with</th>
    <th>2nd starts with</th>
    <th>action</th>
    <th>examples</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>short vowel</td>
    <td>short vowel</td>
    <td>remove 1st word's vowel and concatenate</td>
    <td>వెళ్ళు + అకు = వెళ్ళకు, ఎక్కడ + ఉన్నావు = ఎక్కడున్నావు</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>long vowel</td>
    <td>short vowel</td>
    <td>remove 2nd word's vowel and concatenate</td>
    <td>కూర్చో + అకు = కూర్చోకు</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>long vowel</td>
    <td>long vowel</td>
    <td>remove 1st word's vowel and concatenate</td>
    <td>తింటూ + ఆను = తింటాను</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>vowel</td>
    <td>consonant</td>
    <td>concatenate</td>
    <td>పో + వాలి = పోవాలి</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Imperative

The **imperative form** denotes a request, order, or suggestion.
Here are some example sentences, with the verbs in bold: 

* నీళ్లు **తాగు**. = **Drink** water. = पानी **पियो**।
* ఇది **తీసుకో**. = **Take** this. = यह **लो**।
* **పో**! = **Go**! = **जाओ**!

Moreover, there are sub-types of the imperative form:

* Simple imperative: తిను = eat = खाओ.
* Polite imperative: తినండి = (please) eat = खाइए.
* Negative imperative: తినకు = don't eat = मत खाओ.
* Polite negative imperative: తినకండి = (please) don't eat = मत खाइए.

The simple imperative form is generally considered the primary/defining form of the verb.

The other imperative forms (polite, negative, and polite negative)
can be obtained from the [infinitive](#infinitive) form
by appending (with [sandhi](#sandhi)) an appropriate suffix:

1.  'అకు' to get the negative imperative form.
    E.g., వెళ్ళు → వెళ్ళకు, కూర్చో → కూర్చోకు, అడుగు → అడగకు.
2.  'అండి' to get the polite imperative form.
    E.g., వెళ్ళు → వెళ్ళండి, కూర్చో → కూర్చోండి, అడుగు → అడగండి.
3.  'ఆకండి' to get the polite negative imperative form.
    E.g., వెళ్ళు → వెళ్ళకండి, కూర్చో → కూర్చోకండి, అడుగు → అడగకండి.

See the [Google sheet][google-sheet] for more examples.

## Infinitive

The infinitive form has many functions.

* **Past negative form**: obtained by adding 'లేదు' to the infinitive. Examples:
    * నేను వెళ్ళలేదు. = I did not go. = मैं नहीं गया।
    * ఆమె రాలేదు. = She did not come. = वह नहीं आई।
* **Permissive form**: obtained by adding 'వచ్చు' to the infinitive. Examples:
    * నువ్వు నీళ్ళు తాగవచ్చు. = You may drink water. = तुम पानी पी सकते हो।
    * నేను లోపలికి రావచ్చా? = May I come in? = मैं अंदर आ सकता हूँ क्या?
* **Prohibitive form**: obtained by adding 'కూడదు' to the infinitive. Examples:
    * నువ్వు నీళ్ళు తాగకూడదు. = You may not drink water. = तुम पानी नहीं पी सकते।
    * రవి లోపలికి రాకూడదు. = Ravi cannot come inside. = रवि अंदर नहीं आ सकता।
* [Negative imperative form](#imperative):
    obtained by adding 'అకు' to the infinitive.
* [Polite imperative form](#imperative):
    obtained by adding 'అండి' to the infinitive.

**Transformation Rule**:
Usually, the infinitive form is obtained by appending
అ to the simple imperative form (with [sandhi](#sandhi)).
Examples: వెళ్ళు → వెళ్ళ, కూర్చో → కూర్చో.

There are many exceptions to this rule.
Most exceptions come from *Trisyllabic* verbs.
These are verbs whose imperative form consists of three syllables.
For them, before appending ఆ to the imperative form,
the middle syllable's vowel is changed to అ.
Examples: అడుగు → అడగ, వెతుకు → వెతక.

## Tenses

Verbs take on different forms based on who is doing the action and when the action happens.
For example, here are the different forms of తిను (= eat = खाओ).

* నేను నారింజ _తింటున్నాను_. = I _am eating_ an orange. = मैं संतरा _खा रहा हूँ_।
* మేం రోజూ నారింజలు _తింటాం_. = We _eat_ oranges everyday. = हम रोज़ संतरे _खाते हैं_।
* నేను నారింజ _తిన్నాను_. = I _ate_ an orange. = मैंने संतरा _खाया_।

Modifying a verb based on context is called _verb conjugation_.
In Telugu, verbs are conjugated based on:

1.  **Tense**: the time when an event happens.
2.  **Subject**: The pronoun of the subject, i.e., the person/object doing the action.
3.  Whether the action is **positive** or **negative**.

Conjugating a verb usually involves picking an appropriate form of a verb based on tense
and positivity/negativity, and then appending an appropriate _personal suffix_
based on the subject's pronoun.
So, we will frequently refer to the following table of personal suffixes:

<table id="png-suffix-table">
<tr>
    <th>Subject's <a href="01-nouns-pronouns-vibhakti.html#personal-pronouns">pronoun</a></th>
    <th>positive personal suffix</th>
    <th>negative personal suffix</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>నేను (I)</td>
    <td>ఆను</td>
    <td>ను</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>నువ్వు (You)</td>
    <td>ఆవు</td>
    <td>వు</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>మేం/మనం (We)</td>
    <td>ఆం</td>
    <td>ం</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>మీరు/వారు/వాళ్ళు (You/They)</td>
    <td>ఆరు</td>
    <td>రు</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>అతను/వాడు (He)</td>
    <td>ఆడు</td>
    <td>డు</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>ఆమె/అది (She/It)</td>
    <td>అది</td>
    <td>ది</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>అవి (They)</td>
    <td>ఆయి</td>
    <td>వు</td>
</tr>
</table>

ఉండు (= be = हो) is called the existential verb.

### Simple Present Tense

#### Existential Verb

ఉండు is conjugated in the simple present tense by appending
the [positive personal suffix](#png-suffix-table) to ఉన్న. Examples:

* నేను ఇంట్లో _ఉన్నాను_. = I _am_ at home. = मैं घर पर _हूँ_।
* నువ్వు ఇంట్లో _ఉన్నావు_. = You _are_ at home. = तुम घर पर _हो_।
* మేం ఇంట్లో _ఉన్నాం_. = We _are_ at home. = हम घर पर _हैं_।

By the above rule, the conjugation for ఆమె and అది should be ఉన్నది.
Although ఉన్నది is correct, ఉంది is more common.

* ఆమె ఇంట్లో _ఉంది_. = She _is_ at home. = वह घर पर _है_।

#### Other Verbs

For verbs other than ఉండు, the simple present tense is usually used to describe habits.
Thus, it is also called the _present habitual tense_.
E.g., నేను coffee తాగుతాను. = I drink coffee. = मैं coffee पीता हूँ।

Verbs other than ఉండు are conjugated in the simple present tense
by appending the [positive personal suffix](#png-suffix-table) to
the [present adverbial participle](#present-adverbial-participle)
when the subject is not ఆమె/అది. Examples:

* నేను తింటాను. = I eat. = मैं खाता हूँ।
* మేం నవ్వుతాం. = We laugh. = हम हँसते हैं।

When the subject is ఆమె/అది, in the Telangana dialect, the ఊ at the end of
[present adverbial participle](#present-adverbial-participle) is replaced by
అది in the Telangana dialect and ఉంది elsewhere. Examples:

* (Telangana) అది తింటది. = (Non-Telangana) అది తింటుంది. = It eats. = वह खाता है।
* (Telangana) ఆమె నవ్వుతది. = (Non-Telangana) ఆమె నవ్వుతుంది. = She laughs. = वह हँसती है।

In spoken Telugu, when the subject is నేను, sometimes the final ను is dropped. E.g.,

* నేను తింటా. = I eat. = मैं खाता हूँ।

### Negative Simple Present Tense

#### Existential Verb

ఉండు is conjugated in the negative simple present tense by appending the
[negative personal suffix](#png-suffix-table) to లే.
Examples:

* నేను ఇంట్లో _లేను_. = I _am not_ at home. = मैं घर पर _नहीं हूँ_।
* నువ్వు ఇంట్లో _లేవు_. = You _are not_ at home. = तुम घर पर _नहीं हो_।
* మేం ఇంట్లో _లేం_. = We _are not_ at home. = हम घर पर _नहीं हैं_।
* ఆమె ఇంట్లో _లేదు_. = She _is not_ at home. = वह घर पर _नहीं है_।

#### Other Verbs

Verbs other than ఉండు are conjugated in the negative simple present tense by appending the
[negative personal suffix](#png-suffix-table) to the verb's [infinitive](#infinitive).
Examples:

* నేను coffee తాగను. = I don't drink coffee. = मैं coffee नहीं पीता।
* మేం కూర్చోం. = We don't sit. = हम नहीं बैठते।

### Simple Past Tense

#### Existential Verb

ఉండు is conjugated differently depending on dialect and context.

Method 1: conjugate to ఉండే.

* నేను ఇంట్లో _ఉండే_. = I _was_ at home. = मैं घर पर _था_।
* మేం ఇంట్లో _ఉండే_. = We _were_ at home. = हम घर पर _थे_।
* ఆమె ఇంట్లో _ఉండే_. = She _was_ at home. = वह घर पर _थी_।

Method 2: same as simple present.

* నేను ఇంట్లో _ఉన్నాను_. = I _was_ at home. = मैं घर पर _था_।
* మేం ఇంట్లో _ఉన్నాం_. = We _were_ at home. = हम घर पर _थे_।
* ఆమె ఇంట్లో _ఉంది_. = She _was_ at home. = वह घर पर _थी_।

With method 2, disambiguation between present and past tense is often done by
using the words ఇప్పుడు (= now = अब/अभी) and అప్పుడు (= then = तब).

* నేను _ఇప్పుడు_ ఇంట్లో _ఉన్నాను_. = I _am_ at home _now_. = मैं _अभी_ घर पर _हूँ_।
* నేను _అప్పుడు_ ఇంట్లో _ఉన్నాను_. = I _was_ at home _then_. = मैं _तब_ घर पर _था_।

#### Other Verbs

There are two ways to conjugate the simple past tense.
Method 1 is understood everywhere.
Sometimes method 2 is used in spoken Telangana Telugu.

**Method 1**:

Simple past tense conjugation rule for verbs other than ఉండు
(actually this works for ఉండు too, depending on dialect and context):

1.  If the [past adjectival participle](#past-adjectival-participle) ends with న్న,
    add the [positive personal suffix](#png-suffix-table) to it. Examples:
    * నేను తిన్నాను. = I ate. = मैंने खाया।
    * ఆమె కూర్చున్నది. = She sat. = वह बैठी।
2.  Else, if the subject is ఆమె/అది, append ఇంది to the
    [past adverbial participle](#past-adverbial-participle). Example:
    * ఆమె వచ్చింది. = She came. = वह आई।
3.  Else, append the [positive personal suffix](#png-suffix-table) to the
    [past adverbial participle](#past-adverbial-participle). Example:
    * నేను వచ్చాను. = I came. = मैं आया।

In case 3 above, the ఆ in the positive personal suffix
is pronounced differently: like the 'a' in 'man' or 'cat'.

**Method 2**:

This method only applies to subjects other than ఆమె/అది, and only when the
[past adjectival participle](#past-adjectival-participle) does not end with న్న.

1.  If the subject is నేను, then the conjugation is the same as the
    [past adjectival participle](#past-adjectival-participle). Example:
    * నేను దూకిన. = I jumped. = मैं कूदा।
2.  Otherwise, replace the ఆ in the [positive personal suffix](#png-suffix-table) to అ,
    append this suffix to the [past adjectival participle](#past-adjectival-participle).
    Examples:
    * మేం దూకినం. = We jumped. = हम कूदे।
    * అతను దూకినడు. = He jumped. = वह कूदा।
    * అవి దూకినయి. = They jumped. = वे कूदे।

### Negative Simple Past Tense

#### Existential Verb

ఉండు is conjugated differently depending on dialect and context.

Method 1: conjugate to లేకుండే or లేకపోయింది.

* నేను ఇంట్లో _లేకుండే_. = I _was not_ at home. = मैं घर पर _नहीं था_।
* మేం ఇంట్లో _లేకుండే_. = We _were not_ at home. = हम घर पर _नहीं थे_।
* ఆమె ఇంట్లో _లేకుండే_. = She _was not_ at home. = वह घर पर _नहीं थी_।

Method 2: same as negative simple present.

* నేను ఇంట్లో _లేను_. = I _was not_ at home. = मैं घर पर _नहीं था_।
* మేం ఇంట్లో _లేం_. = We _were not_ at home. = हम घर पर _नहीं थे_।
* ఆమె ఇంట్లో _లేదు_. = She _was not_ at home. = वह घर पर _नहीं थी_।

With method 2, disambiguation between present and past tense is often done by
using the words ఇప్పుడు (= now = अब/अभी) and అప్పుడు (= then = तब).

* నేను _ఇప్పుడు_ ఇంట్లో _లేను_. = I _am not_ at home _now_. = मैं _अभी_ घर पर _नहीं हूँ_।
* నేను _అప్పుడు_ ఇంట్లో _లేను_. = I _was not_ at home _then_. = मैं _तब_ घर पर _नहीं था_।

#### Other Verbs

Verbs other than ఉండు are conjugated in the negative simple past tense by appending the
లేదు to the verb's [infinitive](#infinitive). Examples:

* నేను coffee తాగలేదు. = I didn't drink coffee. = मैंने coffee नहीं पी।
* మేం కూర్చోలేదు. = We didn't sit. = हम नहीं बैठे।

### Simple Future Tense

#### Existential Verb

ఉండు is conjugated in the simple future tense similar to how
other verbs are conjugated in the simple present tense.

ఉండు is conjugated in the simple future tense by
appending the [positive personal suffix](#png-suffix-table) to
ఉంటూ (the [present adverbial participle](#present-adverbial-participle) of ఉండు)
when the subject is not ఆమె/అది. Examples:

* నేను రేపు ఇంట్లో _ఉంటాను_. = I _will be_ at home tomorrow. = मैं कल घर पर _होऊँगा_।
* మేం రేపు ఇంట్లో _ఉంటాం_. = We _will be_ at home tomorrow. = हम कल घर पर _होंगे_।

When the subject is ఆమె/అది, in the Telangana dialect, the ఊ at the end of
ఉంటూ is replaced by అది in the Telangana dialect and ఉంది elsewhere. Example:

* (Telangana) ఆమె రేపు ఇంట్లో _ఉంటది_.
    = (Non-Telangana) ఆమె రేపు ఇంట్లో _ఉంటుంది_.
    = She _will be_ at home tomorrow. = वह कल घर पर _होगी_।

#### Other Verbs

Verbs other than ఉండు are conjugated in the simple future tense in exactly the same way
as they are conjugated in the [simple present tense](#simple-present-tense).
Disambiguation between these two tenses is done by providing additional context.

### Negative Simple Future Tense

Conjugation rule: append the [negative personal suffix](#png-suffix-table)
to the verb's [infinitive](#infinitive). Examples:

* నేను coffee తాగను. = I won't drink coffee. = मैं coffee नहीं पियूँगा।
* మేం కూర్చోం. = We won't sit. = हम नहीं बैठेंगे।

For verbs other than ఉండు, the negative simple future tense is
identical to the [negative simple present tense](#negative-simple-present-tense).
Hence, additional context is often used to disambiguate between them.

### Present Continuous Tense

If the subject is not ఆమె/అది, append the [positive personal suffix](#png-suffix-table)
to the [present adjectival participle](#present-adjectival-participle). Examples:

* నేను తింటున్నాను. = I am eating. = मैं खा रहा हूँ।
* మేం ఆడ్తున్నాం. = We are playing. = हम खेल रहे हैं।

If the subject is ఆమె/అది, in the Telangana dialect, the ఊ at the end of the verb's
[present adverbial participle](#present-adverbial-participle) is replaced by
ఉంది in the Telangana dialect and ఓంది elsewhere. Example:

* (Telangana) అది తింటుంది. = (Non-Telangana) అది తింటోంది. = It is eating. = वह खा रहा है।
* (Telangana) ఆమె నవ్వుతుంది. = (Non-Telangana) ఆమె నవ్వుతోంది. = She is laughing. = वह हँस रही है।

In spoken Telugu, when the subject is నేను, sometimes the final ను is dropped. E.g.,

* నేను తింటున్నా. = I am eating. = मैं खा रहा हूँ।

### Negative Present Continuous Tense

Conjugation rule: append లేదు to the verb's [gerund](#gerund). Examples:

* నేను తినటం లేదు. = I am not eating. = मैं नहीं खा रहा।
* ఆమె రావటం లేదు. = She is not coming. = वह नहीं आ रही।

## Participles

A verb's participle form is used to _describe_ something.
E.g., in the English sentence, "The children _who were playing_ didn't look at us.",
"who were playing" is a _participle_ of the verb _play_,
because "who were playing" describes "the children".

Participles can be _adjectival_, i.e., those that describe nouns and pronouns,
or they can be _adverbial_, i.e., those that describe other verbs.
They often have a tense associated with them (present, past, future)
and they can be positive or negative.

### Present Adverbial Participle

The present adverbial participle is used to describe two actions happening simultaneously.
Examples:

* ఆమె _పాడుతూ_ వచ్చింది. = She came _singing_. = वह _गाते हुए_ आई।
* నేను _తింటూ_ పని చేస్తున్నాను. = I'm working _while eating_. = मैं _खाते हुए_ काम कर रहा हूँ।

This form can often be obtained by adding తూ to the verb's
[imperative](#imperative) form, but there are a lot of exceptions to this rule.

### Past Adverbial Participle

The past adverbial participle is used to describe actions that happen sequentially. Examples:

* చేతులు _కడిగి_ రా. = Wash your hands and come. = हाथ _धोकर_ आओ।
* నేను _తిని_ వెళ్లాను. = I left _after eating_. = मैं _खाकर_ चला गया।

This form can often be obtained by changing the [imperative](#imperative) form's
final ఉ to ఇ, but there are a lot of exceptions to this rule.

### Negative Adverbial Participle

The negative adverbial participle is used to describe an action happening
without another action happening or having happened.

* అతను _తినకుండా_ వెళ్లాడు. = He left _without eating_. = वह _खाए बिना_ चला गया।
* ఆమె _నిద్రపోకుండా_ పని చేస్తోంది.
    = She is working _without sleeping_.
    = वह _बिना सोए_ काम कर रही है।

This form can be obtained by appending అకుండా to the [infinitive](#infinitive)
(or equivalently, by appending ఉండా to the [negative imperative](#imperative)).

### Present Adjectival Participle

The present adjectival participle can describe
either the subject currently doing the action
or the object currently receiving the action.

* పుస్తకం _చదువుతున్న_ అమ్మాయి
    = The girl _who is reading_ the book
    = किताब _पढ़ रही_ लड़की
* అమ్మాయి _చదువుతున్న_ పుస్తకం
    = The book _that_ the girl _is reading_
    = लड़की _द्वारा पढ़ी जा रही_ किताब

Other examples:

* _ఆడుతున్న_ పిల్లలకు చూడు.
    = Look at the children _who are playing_.
    = _खेल रहे_ बच्चों को देखो।
* _తింటున్న_ ఆహారం చప్పగా ఉంది.
    = The food _that's being eaten_ is bland.
    = _खाया जा रहा_ खाना फीका है।

The present adjectival participle can be obtained from the
[present adverbial participle](#present-adverbial-participle)
by replacing the final ఊ with ఉన్న. Examples:

* చదువు: చదువుతూ → చదువుతున్న
* తిను: తింటూ → తింటున్న

### Past Adjectival Participle

The past adjectival participle can describe
either the subject that did the action
or the object that received the action.

* పుస్తకం _చదివిన_ అమ్మాయి
    = The girl _who read_ the book
    = _वह_ लड़खी _जिसने_ किताब _पढ़ी_
* అమ్మాయి _చదివిన_ పుస్తకం
    = The book _read by_ the girl
    = लड़की _द्वारा पढ़ी गई_ किताब

Other examples:

* _వచ్చిన_ పిల్లలకు నీళ్లు ఇవ్వు.
    = Give water to the children _who have come_.
    = _आए हुए_ बच्चों को पानी दो.
* _అడిగిన_ ప్రశ్నలు నీకు గుర్తున్నాయా?
    = Do you remember the questions _that were asked_?
    = तुम्हें _पूछे गए_ प्रश्न याद हैं क्या?

The past adjectival participle can be obtained from the
[past adverbial participle](#past-adverbial-participle).
If the past adverbial participle ends with ని, change the ని to న్న.
Otherwise, append న to the past adverbial participle. Examples:

* అడుగు: అడిగి → అడిగిన
* తిను: తిని → తిన్న
* కూర్చో: కూర్చుని → కూర్చున్న

### Future/Habitual Adjectival Participle

The future/habitual adjectival participle can describe
either the subject that does (or will do) the action
or the object that receives (or will receive) the action.

* coffee _తాగే_ అమ్మాయి
    = The girl _who drinks_ coffee
    = coffee _पीने वाली_ लड़की
* అమ్మాయి _తాగే_ coffee
    = The coffee _that_ the girl _drinks_
    = लड़की _द्वारा पिए जाने वाली_ coffee

Other examples:

* రేపు _వచ్చే_ పిల్లల కోసం ఆహారం ఉందా?
    = Is there food for children _who will come_ tomorrow?
    = कल _आने वाले_ बच्चों के लिए खाना है क्या?

The future/habitual adjectival participle can be obtained from the
[past adverbial participle](#past-adverbial-participle)
by replacing the final ఇ with ఏ. Examples:

* రా: వచ్చి → వచ్చే
* కూర్చో: కూర్చుని → కూర్చునే

### Negative Adjectival Participle

The negative adjectival participle can describe
either the subject that doesn't/didn't do the action
or the object that doesn't/didn't receive the action.

* పుస్తకం _చదవని_ అమ్మాయి
    = The girl _who did not read_ the book
    = _वह_ लड़की _जिसने_ किताब _नहीं पढ़ी_
* అమ్మాయి _చదవని_ పుస్తకం
    = The book _not read by_ the girl
    = _वह_ किताब _जो_ लड़की ने _नहीं पढ़ी_

In Telugu, the negative adjectival participle doesn't change based on tense.

* _ఆడని_ పిల్లలకు చూడు.
    = Look at the children _who are not playing_.
    = _उन_ बच्चों को देखो _जो नहीं खेल रहे_।
* _తినని_ ఆహారం చప్పగా ఉంది.
    = The food _that was not eaten_ is bland.
    = _नहीं खाया गया_ खाना फीका है।

The future/habitual adjectival participle can be obtained by appending ని
to the [infinitive](#infinitive). Examples:

* అడుగు: అడగ → అడగని
* కూర్చో: కూర్చో → కూర్చోని

## Comparative Adverb Forms

### Manner Adverb Form

* Present: నువ్వు _నడుస్తున్నట్లు_ నేను నడవను.
    = I will not walk _the way_ you _are walking_.
    = तुम _जैसे चल रहे हो वैसे_ मैं नहीं चलूँगा।
* Past: వాళ్లు _ఆడినట్లు_ మనం ఆడినకూడదు.
    = We should not play _the way_ they _played_.
    = उन्होंने _जैसे खेला वैसे_ हमें नहीं खेलना चाहिए।
* Habitual: మనం _అనుకునేటట్లు_ జరుగుతుందా?
    = Do things happen _the way_ we _think_?
    = हम _जैसा सोचते हैं वैसा_ होता है क्या?

The derived manner adverb can be derived from the
adjectival [participle](#participles) of the appropriate tense.
For the future/habitual tense, append టట్లు to the participle,
and for the other tenses, append అట్లు to the participle.

Examples:

* Habitual: ఆమె వచ్చేటట్లు = the way she comes = वह जैसे आती है वैसे
* Future: ఆమె వచ్చేటట్లు = the way she will come = वह जैसे आएगी वैसे
* Present: అతను వస్తున్నట్లు = the way he is coming = वह जैसे आ रहा है वैसे
* Past: నేను వచ్చినట్లు = the way I came = मैं जैसे आया वैसे

### Temporal Adverb Form

* Present: నేను _మాట్లాడ్తున్నప్పుడు_ తినకు.
    = Don't eat _while_ I'm _talking_.
    = मैं _जब बात कर रहा हूँ तब_ मत खाओ।
* Future: నువ్వు _వచ్చేటప్పుడు_ నా కోసం పూలు తీసుకురా.
    = _When_ you _come_, bring flowers for me.
    = तुम _जब आओ तब_ मेरे लिए फूल ले आना।
* Past: అతను _వచ్చినప్పుడు_ నా కోసం పూలు తీసుకొచ్చాడు.
    = _When_ he _came_, he brought flowers for me.
    = वह _जब आया तब_ मेरे लिए फूल लाया।

The temporal adverb can be derived from the
adjectival [participle](#participles) of the appropriate tense.
For the future/habitual tense, append టప్పుడు to the participle,
and for the other tenses, append అప్పుడు to the participle.

### Quantitative Adverb Form

* Amount: నా దగ్గర నువ్వు _అడిగినంత_ డబ్బులు లేదు.
    = I don't have _as much_ money _as_ you _asked for_.
    = मेरे पास तुमने _जितना पूछा उतना_ पैसा नहीं है।
* Number: నేను _తిన్నన్ని_ రొట్టెలు నువ్వు కూడా తిను.
    = Eat _as many_ rotis _as_ I _ate_.
    = मैंने _जितनी_ रोटियाँ _खाई उतनी_ तुम भी खाओ।

Construction rule:

* Amount quantitative adverb form is obtained by adding అంత to the
[past adjectival participle](#past-adjectival-participle).
* Number quantitative adverb form is obtained by adding అన్ని to the
[past adjectival participle](#past-adjectival-participle).

## Other Forms

### Gerund

The gerund is a noun form of the verb. Examples:

* నాకు _నిద్రపోవటం_ ఇష్టం. = I like _sleeping_. = मुझे _सोना_ पसंद है।
* ఎక్కువగా _తినటం_ మంచిది కాదు. = _Eating_ a lot is not good. = ज्यादा _खाना_ ठीक नहीं होता।

The gerund is usually formed by appending అటం or అడం to the verb's [infinitive](#infinitive).
Examples:

* అడుగు: అడగ → అడగటం / అడగడం
* తిను: తిన → తినటం / తినడం
* కూర్చో: కూర్చో → కూర్చోటం / కూర్చోడం

For verbs whose infinitive ends with పో, కా, రా, or తే,
the gerund is formed by appending వటం or వడం instead.
Examples:

* రా → రావటం / రావడం
* నిద్రపో → నిద్రపోవటం / నిద్రపోవడం

For verbs whose infinitive ends with కో, either అటం/అడం or వటం/వడం
is appended depending on dialect. Example:

* తీసుకో → తీసుకోటం / తీసుకోవటం

### Conditional

* నువ్వు _వస్తే_ చెప్తాను. = If will tell you _if_ you _come_. = तुम _आओगे तो_ बताऊँगा।
* ఈ అవకాశం _పోతే_ మళ్ళీ రాదు.
    = _If_ this opportunity _is missed_ it won't come again.
    = यह अवसर _चला गया तो_ फिर नही आएगा।

It can often be obtained by replacing the final ఊ in the
[present adverbial participle](#present-adverbial-participle) by ఏ,
but unfortunately there are a lot of exceptions to this rule.

### Obligatory

* నేను పుస్తకం _చదవాలి_. = I _should read_ the book. = मुझे किताब _पढ़नी चाहिए_।
* నువ్వు _కూర్చోవాలి_. = You _should sit_. = तुम्हें _बैठना चाहिए_।
* ఆమె _తినాలి_. = She _should eat_. = उसे _खाना चाहिए_।

The obligatory form can be constructed from the [infinitive](#infinitive).
If the infinitive ends in a long vowel, append వాలి to it, otherwise append ఆలి to it.
Examples:

* అడుగు: అడగ → అడగాలి
* పో: పో → పోవాలి
* తీసుకో: తీసుకో → తీసుకోవాలి

### Hortative

* పోదాం = let's go = चलते हैं
* తిందాం = let's eat = खाते हैं
* కూర్చుందాం = let's sit = बैठते हैं
* రాద్దాం = let's write = लिखते हैं

The hortative can be obtained from the
[present adverbial participle](#present-adverbial-participle).
First, replace the final తూ or టూ with దాం,
and then if it ends with స్డాం, replace that with ద్దాం.
