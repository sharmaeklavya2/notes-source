# Verbs

In this article, we will look at the different forms that verbs can have in Telugu.

I have created a [Google sheet][google-sheet] that contains many examples for
a large number of verb forms.
Some entries in the sheet don't follow the transformation rules described here.
Those entries are highlighted in red or yellow,
depending on how different they are from the transformation rule.

The [imperative](#imperative) form is the primary/defining form of a verb.
The [infinitive](#infinitive) and [participle](#participle) forms
are the most important, since they can be used to construct most of the other forms.

## Sources

My primary source of Telugu grammar is the book
[An Intensive Course in Telugu](https://archive.org/details/dli.language.2300)
by Parimi Ramanarsimham.
The book has multiple chapters, each of which usually starts with
a dialogue in Telugu between people,
followed by exercises, vocabulary, and grammar notes related to the dialogue.
The grammar notes are fragmented across chapters, making it hard to refer to a particular topic.
This article, on the other hand, is a structured reference of verb forms.

My second source of Telugu grammar is my wife, who is a native Telugu speaker from Telangana.
She said that Telangana uses a slightly different dialect of spoken Telugu
compared to the above book. In this article, I have tried documenting these differences
with regards to verb forms.

## Sandhi

We will learn how to transform a verb from one form to other forms.
To do these transformations, we will often need to join two words together.
This process of joining words is called సంధి (संधि / sandhi).
There are many different sandhi rules in Telugu, but for this article,
the rules given by the following table will suffice.
The rules depend on whether the first word ends with a vowel
and whether the second word starts with a vowel.
(Note that అ = अ is considered a vowel, so, e.g.,
మన ends with a vowel, but రాకేష్ and పుస్తకం don't.)

<table>
<tr>
    <th>1st ends with</th>
    <th>2nd starts with</th>
    <th>action</th>
    <th>examples</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>short vowel</td>
    <td>short vowel</td>
    <td>remove 1st word's vowel and concatenate</td>
    <td>వెళ్ళు + అకు = వెళ్ళకు, ఎక్కడ + ఉన్నావు = ఎక్కడున్నావు</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>long vowel</td>
    <td>short vowel</td>
    <td>remove 2nd word's vowel and concatenate</td>
    <td>కూర్చో + అకు = కూర్చోకు</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>long vowel</td>
    <td>long vowel</td>
    <td>remove 1st word's vowel and concatenate</td>
    <td>తింటూ + ఆను = తింటాను</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Imperative

The **imperative form** denotes a request, order, or suggestion.
Here are some example sentences, with the verbs in bold: 

* నీళ్లు **తాగు**. = **Drink** water. = पानी **पियो**।
* ఇది **తీసుకో**. = **Take** this. = यह **लो**।
* **పో**! = **Go**! = **जाओ**!

Moreover, there are sub-types of the imperative form:

* Simple imperative: తిను = eat = खाओ.
* Polite imperative: తినండి = (please) eat = खाइए.
* Negative imperative: తినకు = don't eat = मत खाओ.
* Polite negative imperative: తినకండి = (please) don't eat = मत खाइए.

**Transformation Rule**:
Take the [infinitive form](#infinitive) of the verb and append (with [sandhi](#sandhi)):

1.  'అకు' to get the negative imperative form.
    E.g., వెళ్ళు → వెళ్ళకు, కూర్చో → కూర్చోకు, అడుగు → అడగకు.
2.  'అండి' to get the polite imperative form.
    E.g., వెళ్ళు → వెళ్ళండి, కూర్చో → కూర్చోండి, అడుగు → అడగండి.
3.  'ఆకండి' to get the polite negative imperative form.
    E.g., వెళ్ళు → వెళ్ళకండి, కూర్చో → కూర్చోకండి, అడుగు → అడగకండి.

See the [Google sheet][google-sheet] for more examples.

## Infinitive

The infinitive form has many functions.

* **Past negative form**: obtained by adding 'లేదు' to the infinitive. Examples:
    * నేను వెళ్ళలేదు. = I did not go. = मैं नहीं गया।
    * ఆమె రాలేదు. = She did not come. = वह नहीं आई।
* **Permissive form**: obtained by adding 'వచ్చు' to the infinitive. Examples:
    * నువ్వు నీళ్ళు తాగవచ్చు. = You may drink water. = तुम पानी पी सकते हो।
    * నేను లోపలికి రావచ్చా? = May I come in? = मैं अंदर आ सकता हूँ क्या?
* **Prohibitive form**: obtained by adding 'కూడదు' to the infinitive. Examples:
    * నువ్వు నీళ్ళు తాగకూడదు. = You may not drink water. = तुम पानी नहीं पी सकते।
    * రవి లోపలికి రాకూడదు. = Ravi cannot come inside. = रवि अंदर नहीं आ सकता।

**Transformation Rule**:
Usually, the infinitive form is obtained by appending
ఆ to the imperative form (with [sandhi](#sandhi)).
Examples: వెళ్ళు → వెళ్ళ, కూర్చో → కూర్చో.

There are many exceptions to this rule.
Most exceptions come from *Trisyllabic* verbs.
These are verbs whose imperative form consists of three syllables.
For them, before appending ఆ to the imperative form,
the middle syllable's vowel is changed to అ.
Examples: అడుగు → అడగ, వెతుకు → వెతక

## Tenses

Verbs take on different forms based on who is doing the action and when the action happens.
For example, here are the different forms of తిను (= eat = खाओ).

* నేను నారింజ _తింటున్నాను_. = I _am eating_ an orange. = मैं संतरा _खा रहा हूँ_।
* మేం రోజూ నారింజలు _తింటాం_. = We _eat_ oranges everyday. = हम रोज़ संतरे _खाते हैं_।
* నేను నారింజ _తిన్నాను_. = I _ate_ an orange. = मैंने संतरा _खाया_।

Modifying a verb based on context is called _verb conjugation_.
In Telugu, verbs are conjugated based on:

1.  **Tense**: the time when an event happens.
    In Telugu, there are primarily four tenses:
    simple present, simple past, present continuous, and future continuous.
2.  **Subject**: The pronoun of the subject, i.e., the person/object doing the action.
3.  Whether the action is **positive** or **negative**.

Conjugating a verb usually involves picking an appropriate form of a verb based on tense
and positivity/negativity, and then appending an appropriate _personal suffix_
<span class="secondary">(aka PNG suffix, where PNG stands for Person, Number, Gender)</span>
based on the subject's pronoun.
So, we will frequently refer to the following table of _personal suffixes_:

<table id="png-suffix-table">
<tr>
    <th>Subject's <a href="01-nouns-pronouns-vibhakti.html#personal-pronouns">pronoun</a></th>
    <th>positive personal suffix</th>
    <th>negative personal suffix</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>నేను (I)</td>
    <td>ఆను</td>
    <td>ను</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>నువ్వు (You)</td>
    <td>ఆవు</td>
    <td>వు</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>మేం/మనం (We)</td>
    <td>ఆం</td>
    <td>ం</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>మీరు/వారు/వాళ్ళు (You/They)</td>
    <td>ఆరు</td>
    <td>రు</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>అతను/వాడు (He)</td>
    <td>ఆడు</td>
    <td>డు</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>ఆమె/అది (She/It)</td>
    <td>అది</td>
    <td>ది</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>అవి (They)</td>
    <td>ఆయి</td>
    <td>వు</td>
</tr>
</table>

ఉండు (= be = हो) is called the existential verb.

### Simple Present Tense

#### Existential Verb

ఉండు is conjugated in the simple present tense by appending
the [positive personal suffix](#png-suffix-table) to ఉన్న. Examples:

* నేను ఇంట్లో _ఉన్నాను_. = I _am_ at home. = मैं घर पर _हूँ_।
* నువ్వు ఇంట్లో _ఉన్నావు_. = You _are_ at home. = तुम घर पर _हो_।
* మేం ఇంట్లో _ఉన్నాం_. = We _are_ at home. = हम घर पर _हैं_।

By the above rule, the conjugation for ఆమె and అది should be ఉన్నది.
Although ఉన్నది is correct, ఉంది is more common.

* ఆమె ఇంట్లో _ఉంది_. = She _is_ at home. = वह घर पर _है_।

#### Other Verbs

For verbs other than ఉండు, the simple present tense is usually used to describe habits.
Thus, it is also called the _present habitual tense_.
E.g., నేను coffee తాగుతాను. = I drink coffee. = मैं coffee पीता हूँ।

Verbs other than ఉండు are conjugated in the simple present tense
by appending the [positive personal suffix](#png-suffix-table) to
the [present adverbial participle](#present-adverbial-participle)
when the subject is not ఆమె/అది. Examples:

* నేను తింటాను. = I eat. = मैं खाता हूँ।
* మేం నవ్వుతాం. = We laugh. = हम हँसते हैं।

When the subject is ఆమె/అది, in the Telangana dialect, the ఊ at the end of
[present adverbial participle](#present-adverbial-participle) is replaced by
అది in the Telangana dialect and ఉంది elsewhere. Examples:

* (Telangana) అది తింటది. = (Non-Telangana) అది తింటుంది. = It eats. = वह खाता है।
* (Telangana) ఆమె నవ్వుతది. = (Non-Telangana) ఆమె నవ్వుతుంది. = She laughs. = वह हँसती है।

In spoken Telugu, when the subject is నేను, sometimes the final ను is dropped. E.g.,

* నేను తింటా. = I eat. = मैं खाता हूँ।

### Negative Simple Present Tense

#### Existential Verb

ఉండు is conjugated in the negative simple present tense by appending the
[negative personal suffix](#png-suffix-table) to లే.
Examples:

* నేను ఇంట్లో _లేను_. = I _am not_ at home. = मैं घर पर _नहीं हूँ_।
* నువ్వు ఇంట్లో _లేవు_. = You _are not_ at home. = तुम घर पर _नहीं हो_।
* మేం ఇంట్లో _లేం_. = We _are not_ at home. = हम घर पर _नहीं हैं_।
* ఆమె ఇంట్లో _లేదు_. = She _is not_ at home. = वह घर पर _नहीं है_।

#### Other Verbs

Verbs other than ఉండు are conjugated in the negative simple present tense by appending the
[negative personal suffix](#png-suffix-table) to the verb's [infinitive](#infinitive).
Examples:

* నేను coffee తాగను. = I don't drink coffee. = मैं coffee नहीं पीता।
* మేం కూర్చోం. = We don't sit. = हम नहीं बैठते।

### Simple Past Tense

#### Existential Verb

ఉండు is conjugated differently depending on dialect and context.

Method 1: conjugate to ఉండే.

* నేను ఇంట్లో _ఉండే_. = I _was_ at home. = मैं घर पर _था_।
* మేం ఇంట్లో _ఉండే_. = We _were_ at home. = हम घर पर _थे_।
* ఆమె ఇంట్లో _ఉండే_. = She _was_ at home. = वह घर पर _थी_।

Method 2: same as simple present.

* నేను ఇంట్లో _ఉన్నాను_. = I _was_ at home. = मैं घर पर _था_।
* మేం ఇంట్లో _ఉన్నాం_. = We _were_ at home. = हम घर पर _थे_।
* ఆమె ఇంట్లో _ఉంది_. = She _was_ at home. = वह घर पर _थी_।

With method 2, disambiguation between present and past tense is often done by
using the words ఇప్పుడు (= now = अब/अभी) and అప్పుడు (= then = तब).

* నేను _ఇప్పుడు_ ఇంట్లో _ఉన్నాను_. = I _am_ at home _now_. = मैं _अभी_ घर पर _हूँ_।
* నేను _అప్పుడు_ ఇంట్లో _ఉన్నాను_. = I _was_ at home _then_. = मैं _तब_ घर पर _था_।

#### Other Verbs

There are two ways to conjugate the simple past tense.
Method 1 is understood everywhere.
Sometimes method 2 is used in spoken Telangana Telugu.

**Method 1**:

Simple past tense conjugation rule for verbs other than ఉండు
(actually this works for ఉండు too, depending on dialect and context):

1.  If the [past adjectival participle](#past-adjectival-participle) ends with న్న,
    add the [positive personal suffix](#png-suffix-table) to it. Examples:
    * నేను తిన్నాను. = I ate. = मैंने खाया।
    * ఆమె కూర్చున్నది. = She sat. = वह बैठी।
2.  Else, if the subject is ఆమె/అది, append ఇంది to the
    [past adverbial participle](#past-adverbial-participle). Example:
    * ఆమె వచ్చింది. = She came. = वह आई।
3.  Else, append the [positive personal suffix](#png-suffix-table) to the
    [past adverbial participle](#past-adverbial-participle). Example:
    * నేను వచ్చాను. = I came. = मैं आया।

In case 3 above, the ఆ in the positive personal suffix
is pronounced differently: like the 'a' in 'man' or 'cat'.

**Method 2**:

This method only applies to subjects other than ఆమె/అది, and only when the
[past adjectival participle](#past-adjectival-participle) does not end with న్న.

1.  If the subject is నేను, then the conjugation is the same as the
    [past adjectival participle](#past-adjectival-participle). Example:
    * నేను దూకిన. = I jumped. = मैं कूदा।
2.  Otherwise, replace the ఆ in the [positive personal suffix](#png-suffix-table) to అ,
    append this suffix to the [past adjectival participle](#past-adjectival-participle).
    Examples:
    * మేం దూకినం. = We jumped. = हम कूदे।
    * అతను దూకినడు. = He jumped. = वह कूदा।
    * అవి దూకినయి. = They jumped. = वे कूदे।

### Negative Simple Past Tense

#### Existential Verb

ఉండు is conjugated differently depending on dialect and context.

Method 1: conjugate to లేకుండే.

* నేను ఇంట్లో _లేకుండే_. = I _was not_ at home. = मैं घर पर _नहीं था_।
* మేం ఇంట్లో _లేకుండే_. = We _were not_ at home. = हम घर पर _नहीं थे_।
* ఆమె ఇంట్లో _లేకుండే_. = She _was not_ at home. = वह घर पर _नहीं थी_।

Method 2: same as negative simple present.

* నేను ఇంట్లో _లేను_. = I _was not_ at home. = मैं घर पर _नहीं था_।
* మేం ఇంట్లో _లేం_. = We _were not_ at home. = हम घर पर _नहीं थे_।
* ఆమె ఇంట్లో _లేదు_. = She _was not_ at home. = वह घर पर _नहीं थी_।

With method 2, disambiguation between present and past tense is often done by
using the words ఇప్పుడు (= now = अब/अभी) and అప్పుడు (= then = तब).

* నేను _ఇప్పుడు_ ఇంట్లో _లేను_. = I _am not_ at home _now_. = मैं _अभी_ घर पर _नहीं हूँ_।
* నేను _అప్పుడు_ ఇంట్లో _లేను_. = I _was not_ at home _then_. = मैं _तब_ घर पर _नहीं था_।

#### Other Verbs

Verbs other than ఉండు are conjugated in the negative simple past tense by appending the
లేదు to the verb's [infinitive](#infinitive). Examples:

* నేను coffee తాగలేదు. = I didn't drink coffee. = मैंने coffee नहीं पी।
* మేం కూర్చోలేదు. = We didn't sit. = हम नहीं बैठे।

### Simple Future Tense

#### Existential Verb

ఉండు is conjugated in the simple future tense similar to how
other verbs are conjugated in the simple present tense.

ఉండు is conjugated in the simple future tense by
appending the [positive personal suffix](#png-suffix-table) to
ఉంటూ (the [present adverbial participle](#present-adverbial-participle) of ఉండు)
when the subject is not ఆమె/అది. Examples:

* నేను రేపు ఇంట్లో _ఉంటాను_. = I _will be_ at home tomorrow. = मैं कल घर पर _होऊँगा_।
* మేం రేపు ఇంట్లో _ఉంటాం_. = We _will be_ at home tomorrow. = हम कल घर पर _होंगे_।

When the subject is ఆమె/అది, in the Telangana dialect, the ఊ at the end of
ఉంటూ is replaced by అది in the Telangana dialect and ఉంది elsewhere. Example:

* (Telangana) ఆమె రేపు ఇంట్లో _ఉంటది_.
    = (Non-Telangana) ఆమె రేపు ఇంట్లో _ఉంటుంది_.
    = She _will be_ at home tomorrow. = वह कल घर पर _होगी_।

#### Other Verbs

Verbs other than ఉండు are conjugated in the simple future tense in exactly the same way
as they are conjugated in the [simple present tense](#simple-present-tense).
Disambiguation between these two tenses is done by providing additional context.

### Negative Simple Future Tense

Conjugation rule: append the [negative personal suffix](#png-suffix-table)
to the verb's [infinitive](#infinitive). Examples:

* నేను coffee తాగను. = I won't drink coffee. = मैं coffee नहीं पियूँगा।
* మేం కూర్చోం. = We won't sit. = हम नहीं बैठेंगे।

For verbs other than ఉండు, the negative simple future tense is
identical to the [negative simple present tense](#negative-simple-present-tense).
Hence, additional context is often used to disambiguate between them.

### Present Continuous Tense

If the subject is not ఆమె/అది, append the [positive personal suffix](#png-suffix-table)
to the [present adjectival participle](#present-adjectival-participle). Examples:

* నేను తింటున్నాను. = I am eating. = मैं खा रहा हूँ।
* మేం ఆడ్తున్నాం. = We are playing. = हम खेल रहे हैं।

If the subject is ఆమె/అది, in the Telangana dialect, the ఊ at the end of the verb's
[present adverbial participle](#present-adverbial-participle) is replaced by
ఉంది in the Telangana dialect and ఓంది elsewhere. Example:

* (Telangana) అది తింటుంది. = (Non-Telangana) అది తింటోంది. = It is eating. = वह खा रहा है।
* (Telangana) ఆమె నవ్వుతుంది. = (Non-Telangana) ఆమె నవ్వుతోంది. = She is laughing. = वह हँस रही है।

In spoken Telugu, when the subject is నేను, sometimes the final ను is dropped. E.g.,

* నేను తింటున్నా. = I am eating. = मैं खा रहा हूँ।

### Negative Present Continuous Tense

Conjugation rule: append లేదు to the verb's [gerund](#gerund). Examples:

* నేను తినటం లేదు. = I am not eating. = मैं नहीं खा रहा।
* ఆమె రావటం లేదు. = She is not coming. = वह नहीं आ रही।

## Participles

A verb's participle form is used to _describe_ something.
E.g., in the English sentence, "The children _who were playing_ didn't look at us.",
"who were playing" is a _participle_ of the verb _play_,
because "who were playing" describes "the children".

Participles can be _adjectival_, i.e., those that describe nouns and pronouns,
or they can be _adverbial_, i.e., those that describe other verbs.
They often have a tense associated with them (present, past, future)
and they can be positive or negative.

### Present Adverbial Participle

### Past Adverbial Participle

### Negative Adverbial Participle

### Present Adjectival Participle

### Past Adjectival Participle

### Future Adjectival Participle

### Negative Adjectival Participle

## Other Forms

### Gerund

### Conditional

### Obligatory

### Hortative
