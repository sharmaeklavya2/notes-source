# Lecture notes for Game Theory

Lecture notes for the Game Theory course at IISc (Feb-May 2021),
taught by [Prof. Y. Narahari](https://gtl.csa.iisc.ac.in/hari/).

The course is conducted online. Textbook: <https://gtl.csa.iisc.ac.in/hari/book.html>,
<https://www.amazon.in/Game-Theory-Mechanism-Design-Lecture/dp/9814525049>.

These notes closely follow (but do not exactly replicate) what is taught in class.
These notes contain a few additions, omissions and modifications to what was taught in class.

These notes are meant to be a terse reference for me.
If you're learning game theory for the first time,
I recommend not using these notes as the only source.
