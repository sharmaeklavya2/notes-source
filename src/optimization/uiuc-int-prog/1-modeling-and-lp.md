* Set-covering problem
* Capacitated facility location problem
* Fixed-charge min-cost network flow problem
* Uncapacitated Production Lot-Sizing

## 2.1 - Linear Programming

* How to write the dual of an LP.
* Weak duality (with proof).
* Strong duality.
* Complementary slackness.
* Farkas' Lemma.
* Primal simplex algorithm:
    * Defn: basis, basic solution, primal feasible basis, dual feasible basis.
    * Correspondence between (primal feasible) basis and (primal feasible) basic solution.
    * Primal simplex algorithm.
